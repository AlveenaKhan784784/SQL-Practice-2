### SQL Practice: Basics, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries, and CTEs

#### Overview:
This project provides hands-on practice with SQL fundamentals, including basic queries, aggregate functions, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). A sales table is created and populated with sample data to explore these concepts.

#### SQL Queries Practiced:
1. SQL Basics
2. Aggregate functions
3. Subqueries
4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

#### Questions We Address:

##### Basic Queries:
1. How do you retrieve all records from a table?
2. How can you filter data based on a condition (e.g., quantity sold > 5)?
3. How do you get distinct values from a column?

##### Aggregate functions:
4. How do you calculate the total revenue from sales?
5. What is the average quantity sold across all records?
6. How can you find the highest and lowest unit prices in the dataset?
7. How do you count the total number of sales records?

##### Subqueries:
8. How can you find products that have a unit price greater than the average unit price?

##### Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
9. How can you calculate total revenue per region using a CTE?
10. How do you filter the results of a CTE to show only regions with revenue above a certain threshold?

#### Learning Outcomes:

- Understand SQL basics: Creating tables, inserting data, and running queries.
- Apply aggregate functions: Summarizing data using SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX.
- Use subqueries: Extracting insights with nested queries.
- Implement CTEs: Structuring queries for better readability and efficiency.
